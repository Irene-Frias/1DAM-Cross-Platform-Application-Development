# Database
This repository contains a collection of database exercises developed as part of the Cross-Platform Application Development course at I.E.S. Bel√©n (M√°laga). These activities are designed to strengthen understanding of database principles and are largely based on materials provided by the course instructor.

To begin working with these exercises, you'll need a development environment capable of creating and managing databases writing queries, inserting data, and more. A recommended setup includes installing tools like this [folder](https://github.com/Irene-Frias/Database/tree/main/UNIT%203%20-%20Creaci%C3%B3n%20Base%20de%20Datos/Instalaci%C3%B3n%20de%20servicios%20y%20Clientes%20gr%C3%A1ficos) along with a database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## üìö Units
The topics covered during the course are listed below in each of the following sections.
### Unit 1 - Introduction to Databases
- A database is an organized collection of data that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and management. Databases are essential in modern applications, enabling structured data organization for businesses, websites, and various systems. This unit covers the importance of databases, types *(relational and non-relational)*, and fundamental concepts like tables, records, and fields.

### Unit 2 - Entity-Relationship Model and Relations
- The *Entity-Relationship (E-R)* model is a high-level conceptual framework used to design databases. It represents entities (objects or concepts), their attributes, and the relationships between them. Understanding ER diagrams is crucial for designing efficient databases. This unit also covers relational concepts, normalization, and the transition from ER models to relational schemas.

### Unit 3 - Database Creation
- Creating a database involves defining its structure using a *Database Management System (DBMS)* such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle. This unit introduces *SQL (Structured Query Language)* and its fundamental commands for defining tables, setting primary and foreign keys, specifying constraints, and managing relationships. Topics include schema creation, indexing, and best practices for database design.

### Unit 4 - Queries
- Queries are essential for retrieving specific data from a database. SQL provides powerful commands like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `JOIN` to filter and aggregate data effectively. This unit covers writing queries to extract meaningful information, optimize performance, and utilize advanced SQL functions such as subqueries and views.

### Unit 5 - Data Insertion and Manipulation
- Beyond querying, databases require inserting, updating, and deleting records. This unit explores SQL commands such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, along with transaction management techniques using `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`. It also discusses data integrity constraints, error handling, and batch processing for efficient data manipulation.

### Unit 6 - PL-SQL and Advanced Database Programming
- *PL-SQL (Procedural Language for SQL)* extends SQL with procedural capabilities, allowing developers to write complex scripts, stored procedures, functions, and triggers within a database. This unit covers PL/SQL syntax, control structures, exception handling, and optimizing stored routines for performance and security.

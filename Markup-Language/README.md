# Markup-Language
Markup-Language exercises carried out for the subject of Cross-Platform Application Development at I.E.S. Bel√©n (M√°laga).
Most of the exercises in this repository are taken from the programming manual by the teacher. Also with the help of the notes on this page called consortium [`World Wide Web (W3C)`](https://www.w3.org/) is an international consortium that generates recommendations and standards.

To start working it is necessary to have a development site where you can program. In this case I will install the [`Visual Code Studios`](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## üìö Units
The topics covered during the course are listed below in each of the following sections.
### Unit 1 - Basic Concepts XML
- **`XML`** *(Extensible Markup Language)* is a markup language designed to store and transport data in a structured, readable format. Unlike `HTML`, which defines the appearance and structure of a webpage, `XML` focuses solely on data storage and organization, without predefined tags.
  
### Unit 2 - Concepts HTML and CSS 
- **`HTML`**  *(Hypertext Markup Language)* provides the structure of a web page by defining elements like text, images, links, tables, and forms. It uses tags to identify different parts of a page.
- **`CSS`** *(Combined Charging System)* is used to control the layout and design of a web page, including colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and more. It separates content `HTML` from design `CSS`.

### Unit 3 - Key Web Development Concepts: JavaScript, DOM, and JSON
- **`JavaScript`** is an event-driven programming language that adds interactivity to web pages, such as handling mouse clicks, animations, and more. It is used to manipulate the `DOM`, respond to user actions, validate forms, make server requests, and more. Together with `HTML` and `CSS`, it forms the foundation of web development.
- **`DOM`** *(Document Object Model)* is a tree-like representation of an `HTML` or `XML` document. It allows developers to manipulate web page elements, enabling JavaScript to dynamically change the content, structure, and style in real time.
- **`JSON`** *(JavaScript Object Notation)* is a lightweight data exchange format that uses a key-value pair structure. It is easy to read and write, commonly used for storing and transferring data between servers and web applications. `JSON` is language-independent and organizes data using objects and arrays.

### Unit 4 - Defining and Validating XML with DTD: Structure, Rules, and Applications
- **`DTD`** *(Document Type Definition)* is a set of rules that determines the structure and format that an `XML` document must follow. Its purpose is to ensure that an `XML` document is valid, that is, that it complies with a previously defined structure.
`XML` is widely used in web applications, databases, and information exchange systems because of its ability to represent data in a human- and machine-readable manner.

- **`XML Schema`** *(XSD - XML Schema Definition)* is a more powerful and flexible alternative to `DTD` for defining the structure and constraints of an `XML` document. It allows specifying data types, element relationships, and validation rules in a more precise way.
Unlike `DTD`, `XML Schema` is written in `XML` itself, making it more extensible and easier to integrate with modern applications. It supports namespaces, data types (such as integers, dates, and booleans), and complex structures, making it widely used in web services, data validation, and structured information exchange.

### Unit 5 - XSLT Transformations: Concepts, Syntax, and Applications
- **`XSLT`** *(eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)*  is a language used to transform `XML` documents into different formats, such as `HTML`, plain text, or even other `XML` documents. It separates content from presentation, making it easier to manage and reuse data.
`XSLT` works by applying a set of templates and rules to an `XML` source, using `XPath` to select specific elements or attributes. The result of the transformation is usually a new document with a structure and appearance tailored to a specific purpose or audience.

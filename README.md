# Markup-Language
Markup-Language exercises carried out for the subject of Cross-Platform Application Development at I.E.S. Bethlehem (Malaga).
Most of the exercises in this repository are taken from the programming manual by the teacher. Also with the help of the notes on this page called consortium [`World Wide Web (W3C)`](https://www.w3.org/) is an international consortium that generates recommendations and standards.

To start working it is necessary to have a development site where you can program. In this case I will install the [`Visual Code Studios`](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## 📚 Units
The topics covered during the course are listed below in each of the following sections.
### Unit 1 - Basic Concepts XML
`XML` is a markup language designed to store and transport data in a structured, readable format. Unlike `HTML`, which defines the appearance and structure of a webpage, `XML` focuses solely on data storage and organization, without predefined tags.
